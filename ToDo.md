## To Do 1
Just get basic movement and flow going, focus on refining the character player control 

1. ~~Basic Left Right Movement~~
2. ~~Jump determined based of how long W was held~~
3. ~~Get arrow indicating where Irene will shoot working following mouse around her~~
4. ~~Configure speed numbers to make a bit more sense (Might change again after sprite change)~~
4a. ~~Movement has been a little refined but needs more tweeks~~
    - ~~minimum jump height when canceled the earliest ~~
    - ~~x movement very abrupt but maybe thats what i want~~
    - ~~gravity increased when pressing down ~~
5. ~~Fix Double jump mechanic, when running off ledge, can only jump once midair~~
6. Dummy sprite to have better testing (Maybe) <span style="color:red"> Move to '**ToDo2**'</span>
7. ~~Try to auto match the layer to detect for ground to stop manually assigning from unity~~
8. ~~Glide Mechanic~~

## To Do 2
Have players be able to interact with other gameobjects in the game

1. Dummy Sprites implementation
2. ~~Irene Art~~
3. Fix interaction when player running into wall and gets stuck to it
4. Dialogue Box UI interaction
- History
- Auto (Maybe)
- Not implementing Skip button

1. Have projectile come out and interact with other gameobject
2. Have Enemy Object (Basic enemy that approaches player)
3. Dummy Sprite for Player and Enemy
4. Add sfx to when walkingv/firing
5. Consider melee attack pattern
6. Implement health and Arts bar UI
7. Irene UI
8. Irene talking ui

## To Do 3
Not sure what To Do Milestone this should be if the one on the top covers interaction between gameobjects. Perhaps more enemy types can be considered here
1. Flying Enemies
2. Plot progression of gameplay (Endless or story)
3. Item availability (Gun, Lantern) Depends on whether we go for story route

Story route would require research into doing cutscenes potentially


## Uncategorized
- Create Sprite Sheet for Irene and enemies
- Background
- Melee combat mechanic undecided 
- Enemy types undecided
- 

Note:
- Careful messing with scale with child nodes, might make the child scale weirdly so keep it (1,1,1)
- Changing rigidbody velocity much better for fast and accurate movement, force for physics interaction is better suited
